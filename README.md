# IDB_Wrapper
Sane defaults for indexedDB

This is my first attempt to build a wrapper for https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API

Imo the main problem with idb api is its urge to serve every possible usecase.. For 99% of my usecases most of its features are overkill. 
I did't want to use something bloated like dexie.js.. Or some overcomplicated typescript wrappers.

All I need is a simple way to structure, get / set and observe my idbs
